# Spotify Landing Page Clone Project

Hello!

I used my new learned CSS skills on the project assigned by Ironhack, on Week 1, day 2.

I pushed myself to don't use any AI tool for this project. I just searched Google and checked my notes when I stucked. After this little journey, I'm glad to say this, I finished it successfuly.

This is my first of writing README.md, I'm trying to improve my English and the ability of literal explanation without help. I hope it is clear to understand.

Here is the screenshot of the clone project:
